# In this folder we stored all the jupyter notebooks for the single analysis

Every single file is independent from the others, and can be runned (once downloaded the respective file of functions) independently from the rest.

Careful: to run the two CRQ you have to run the Filter.ipnyb file that will prepare the datasets beforehand.
