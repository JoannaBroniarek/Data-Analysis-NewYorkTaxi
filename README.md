# ADM-HW2
Repository for the second homework of the course ADM 2018 at Sapienza university. Repository of Davide Facchinelli, Eltaj Babanli, Joanna Broniarek.

In the main repository there is a single jupyter notebook file contaning all our final analysis. Most of the used functions has been imported in the notebook from other python files, that can be found in the folder called "functions". The folder called "notebooks" contains one notebook for each analysis: to run them singulary if needed.<br/>In the last analysis we did we produced three maps as .html files: they are stored in the folder called "maps".

It's always assumed that notebook files, the function files and the datasets are in the same folder at the moment of the execution.

For the first five analysis the datasets used are the one for the first six months of the 2018 on http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml <br/>
For the last two analysis we used cleaned datasets. The code we used to clean them is the one corresponding to the notebook "Filtration".
