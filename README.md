# Analysis of taxi travelling in New York city in 2018

Repository for the second homework of the course Algorithms of Data Mining 2018 at Sapienza University in Rome.

The data from the following website was used for the analysis:
http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml 

In the main repository there is a single jupyter notebook file contaning all our final analysis. Most of the used functions has been imported in the notebook from the external python files, that can be found in the folder called "functions". The folder called "notebooks" contains one notebook for each analysis: to run them singulary if needed.<br/>In the last analysis we produced three maps as .html files: they are stored in the folder called "maps".

It's always assumed that notebook files, the function files and the datasets are in the same folder at the moment of the execution.

For the last two analysis we used cleaned datasets. The code we used to clean them is in the notebook "Filtration".

The repository authors are Joanna Broniarek, Davide Facchinelli, Eltaj Babanli. My participation in this work includes mainly the part of RQ3, RQ5 and CRQ2 analysis.
