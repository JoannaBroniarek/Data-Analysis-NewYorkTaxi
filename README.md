**This project contains the analysis of Taxis in NYC in 2018**. The aim was to answer to some specific research questions (RQs) that may help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

The analysis was based on the open data of Taxi's trips in NYC. In order to answer to the RQs we took into account the data related to Yellow cab for the year 2018. **Source: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml**

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
+ [RQ1] **In what period of the year Taxis are used more?**
+ [RQ2] **What are the time slots with more passengers?**
+ [RQ3] **Do the all trips last the same?** 
+ [RQ4] **What is the most common way of payments?** 
+ [RQ5] **Does a long distance correlate with the duration of the trip on average?**

## Core Research Questions
+ [CRQ1] **Does the fare for mile change across NY's borough? We want to discover whether the expenses of a user that enjoys Taxis in one zone is different from those that uses it in another one.**
+ [CRQ2] **Visualisation of Taxis movements according to Taxis zones.**

### Content 
**In the main repository there is a single jupyter notebook file "Homework_2.ipynb" contaning all our final analysis.** Most of the used functions has been imported in the notebook from the external python files, that can be found in the folder called "functions". The folder called "notebooks" contains one notebook for each analysis: to run them singulary if needed.<br/>In the last analysis it was produced three maps as .html files: they are stored in the folder called "maps".

### Technology
Python 3.6.4
